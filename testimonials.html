        <p class="emphasis left">“BeetsNthyme catered our post-wedding brunch for 130 people in April 2019. Her food was delicious and thoughtfully designed to feed as many people as possible on our budget. She was super responsive to last minute changes and basically set up the whole event in our small dining room and kitchen by herself because the bride and groom were sleeping in.<br><br>
        It really brought us a lot of joy to host all of our friends and family in our home and feed them really delicious food and we couldn't have done this without Mina's support. She went above and beyond to make the event feel special- she even took time as she was cleaning up for meal prep to make me [the bride] a special plate of eggs because we arrived too late in the morning and missed all of the food. <br><br>
        BeetsNthyme also catered a school professional development event in August 2019. She prepared a Taco Tuesday meal for 100 hungry teachers that was spoken about by staff as the best catered taco lunch we had in recent years.”

            <p class="emphasis left">"Sometimes, a pop-up is born of a person who shouldn't be cooking on a restaurant line, as they have so much more to offer their community; Mina's Beets 'n' Thyme is one such operation that needs to be on your radar if you have any desire for freshness of ingredients and their thoughtful preparation. <br><br>
            As a culinary professional who often hasn't the "thyme" to cook for himself, seeking out B'n'T at Parleaux or Wayward Owl <i>(back-when)</i> breweries on the way home always made for a nourishing conclusion to the day, and having also enjoyed her catering at a few Propeller events, I can attest that Mina's skills shine just as bright in party-sized preparations. I highly recommended for those conscious of what they consume.

            <p class="emphasis left">“Mina makes food that speaks to your soul while showcasing the bounty of local farmers and fishermen. I've been lucky to experience Mina's food in many different environments. No matter the occasion, Mina delivers outstanding food that bursts with flavor. She takes care in crafting menus adaptable to any and all occasions, from backyard party to wedding reception; from festival cooking to catered box lunches, I’ve seen her do it all and her food always shines.<br> <br>

            I’ve hired and recommended Mina and BeetsNThyme every time I have the opportunity. She’s made incredible spreads for St. James Cheese Company’s holiday party as our go-to caterer. When a specialty oil and vinegar sponsor of ‘Fete des Fromages – New Orleans Cheese Fest!’ needed a dish featuring their products prepared for thousands to try, Mina delivered. She catered a hangover-curing, post-wedding brunch for 150 guests in my friend’s small kitchen that left guests raving.<br> <br>

            Mina is a true professional. She crafts custom menus that delight your senses. She draws inspiration from seasonal produce that she sources from local urban farms and regional growers. She is laid back and can make it work with the most unconventional of venues.<br> <br>

            And the best part is, when you hire Mina, you’re not just hiring a kick-ass chef and entrepreneur. You’re supporting someone who gives generously to her community through youth education around food and cooking, sustainable food policy advocacy, and racial justice organizing.<br> <br>

            Hire Mina! She's the best!"
