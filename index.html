    <p class="editable">Maybe you're here because you need a new recipe, plant tips, or help planning the perfect dinner party.  Either way I hope as you browse my site you feel at ease and inspired. One of the greatest things to happen in the insanity that is the year 2020 is that we all had to reconnect with our homes. I've worked in the food industry since I was a teenager and these experiences combined with my innate love and passion for entertaining have led me here!  BeetsnThyme started as a food popup in New Orleans, LA in the spring of 2018 and has blossomed into a project where I can share my skills from gardening to cooking, from event planning to making the most of your home with good food and good vibes.</p>

    <h2 class="editable"> The Garden </h2>
    <p class="editable">Using local food has always been important to me.  Growing up in Pennsylvania  it was just the norm for my family to shop at farmer's markets, befriend farmers and growers, and to use ingredients seasonally. As a chef dedicated to mindful, joyful cooking, a love of food naturally translates to a love of growing. With my years of growing, studying, and consuming food grown locally and sustainably, I've gained plant knowledge that I can't wait to share with you!</p>
